# Plotting with Seaborn - Heatmaps , 


### Heatmap 

It's a visual way to display a table of numbers. With tabular data it can be hard to see what features have high or low values, in their relationship to another feature, compared to the rest. Seaborn's heatmap will accept missing values but show blank squares, so to avoid it fill na with 0. By default 0 gets mapped to the darkest color and max value gets lightest color. 

Most common use is to plot correlations . If you want to draw attention to the positive correlation, choose an appropriate palette color. Human eye is likely to be drawn to darker colors first which is opposite of the default. Seaborn has 170 different color palettes 

You cna also annotate values in every square. Default has scientific notation format. It's usually better to let seaborn automatically decide the color of the font in annotations.


```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
df.corr() 
sns.heatmap(df.corr())
sns.heatmap(df[[col1,col2]],cmap = "Blues" ) # One color that varies from lightest to darrkest shade
sns.heatmap(df.corr(),cmap = "RdBu", center=0 ) # A diverging color palette - Red down Blue up.
# Maps white to 0 ass the center. You can set vmin and vmax as -1,1 to make sure the scale on the right shows this range
sns.heatmap(df.corr(),cmap = "RdBu", annot=True,fmt=".0f", annot_kws={'fontsize': 3,'color':'black'}) 

# put a line between the squares, which are usualy rectangles
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), linewidths=1, linecolor="black", square=True)
# Add ticklabels - xticklabels =False , yticklabels = labels 

```
