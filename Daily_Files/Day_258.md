#H3 

We decided to create H3 to combine the benefits of a hexagonal global grid system with a hierarchical indexing system.

A global grid system usually requires at least two things: a map projection and a grid laid on top of the map. A map projection is needed for going from a three-dimensional location on Earth to a two dimensional point on a map. A grid is then overlaid on the map, forming a global grid system.

This process can be accomplished in innumerable ways by combining different map projections and grids, for example, the widely recognized Mercator projection and a square grid. While this simple method would work, it has a number of drawbacks. To start, the Mercator projection has significant size distortion, so some cells will have vastly different areas. Square grids also have drawbacks, requiring multiple sets of coefficients when used for analysis. This disadvantage is a result of squares having two different types of neighbors, one type with which they share an edge (in the four cardinal directions) and another type with which they share a vertex (in four diagonal directions).

For map projection, we chose to use gnomonic projections centered on icosahedron faces. This projects from Earth as a sphere to an icosahedron, a twenty-sided platonic solid. An icosahedron-based map projection results in twenty separate two-dimensional planes rather than a single plane. The icosahedron can be unfolded in many ways, producing a two-dimensional map each time. H3, however, does not unfold the icosahedron to build its grid system, and instead lays its grid out on the icosahedron faces themselves, forming a geodesic discrete global grid system.

 hexagons have only one distance between a hexagon centerpoint and its neighborsâ€™, compared to two distances for squares or three distances for triangles. This property greatly simplifies performing analysis and smoothing over gradients.

The basic functions of the H3 library are for indexing locations, which transforms latitude and longitude pairs to a 64-bit H3 index, identifying a grid cell. The function geoToH3 takes a latitude, longitude, and resolution (between 0 and 15, with 0 being coarsest and 15 being finest), and returns an index. h3ToGeo and h3ToGeoBoundary are the inverse of this function, providing the center coordinates and outline of the grid cell specified by the H3 index, respectively.


Neighboring hexagons have the useful property of approximating circles using the grid system. The kRing function provides grid cells within grid distance k of an origin index.
