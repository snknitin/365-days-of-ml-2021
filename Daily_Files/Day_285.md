## Plotting with Seaborn

### Boxplot 

We're finding the median. Then divide the data and get the medians of the other two halves. 25% and 75% will give you the IQR. It helps you find outliers and is good for categorical since it is a categorical distribution plot that helps you understand your data with summary statistics. 



```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
sns.boxplot(x = cat_col, y= df.col,data=df)
sns.boxplot(x = cat_col, y= df.col, data=df, hue= df.col2) # For each X have multiple boxplots for each hue
# You can change the order of the plots by sending a list of values to order=[] and hue_order=[]
# width = , line_width =, whis = changes whiskers but this can affect how many outliers are visible 
# outlier diamonds are fliers= 

```



### Violin plot

One part boxplot and two parts kde plot - mix them together and you get a violin plot. It is symmetric. 

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
sns.violinplot(x=cat_col, y=col,data=df,hue=col2) # if you only have 2 categories in hue, yoou can use the split parameter to splice two violin plots 

sns.violinplot(x=cat_col, y=col,data=df,hue=col2,inner='quartiles') # shows quartiles . setting None will remove box plot
sns.violinplot(x=cat_col, y=col,data=df,hue=col2,split=True,scale='count',scale_hue=False) # Show proportionate size of the plots to the count

#scale='width' means each violin plot is scaled to have similar width
```




### Swarm plot

Sort data and group it by value. one circular dot for each data point.  Looks like a bee swarm. Dodge is default t true for the above plots but False for Swarm. 

You can overlay both the swarm and box/violin plots in the same jupyter cell 


```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
sns.swarmplot(df.col)
sns.swarmplot(x=col1,y=col2,data=df) # if all data comes from same dataframe

sns.swarmplot(x=col1,y=col2,data=df,hue=col3,dodge=True) # Dodge will help you separate the overlay of the hues 

```
