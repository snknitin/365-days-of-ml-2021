## Python tricks and tips for better coding


* **Pipe** - Pipe is a Python library that enables you to use pipes in Python. A pipe (|) passes the results of one method to another method. you can insert one method after another method using pipes. As a result, using pipes removes nested parentheses and makes the code more readable. When you have nested iterables you can chain them into a sequence and if there are still some nesting inc=stances you cna use traverse to unroll everything into one list . Group things ina list into a dict or a list and then use select to perform additional operations. 
 

       pip install pipe

```python
import pipe as pp
arr= [1,2,3,4,5]

list(arr | pp.where(lambda x : x%2==0) | pp.select(lambda x:x*2))   # [4,8]
list((1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
    | pp.groupby(lambda x:"Even" if x%2==0 else "Odd")
    |pp.select(lambda x:{x[0]:list(x[1] | pp.where(lambda x:x>=5))})) # [{'Even':[6,8],'Odd':[5,7,9]}]

list((1,2,2,3,4,5,6,5,4)| pp.dedup(lambda key:key<5))  # [1,5]

# pp.chain(function) - chain everything into one sequence of iterables 
# pp.traverse(function) - unnest everything
# pp.dedup(function) -  remove all duplicates
# pp.groupby(function) - use a group by function and then send it to select 


f()
```
