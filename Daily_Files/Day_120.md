## Python tricks and tips for better coding

* Use Cython (C Python) â€” usually, it is up to 100 times faster than pure Python. `%load_ext Cython` in a  cell and ue `%%cython` as a decorator over the methods. If you really have to loop, decorate your custom functions with @numba.jit after installing Numba. JIT (just-in-time) compilation converts pure Python to native machine instructions, enabling you to achieve C, C++, and Fortran-like speeds.

* **Pipe** - Pipe is a Python library that enables you to use pipes in Python. A pipe (|) passes the results of one method to another method. you can insert one method after another method using pipes. As a result, using pipes removes nested parentheses and makes the code more readable. When you have nested iterables you can chain them into a sequence and if there are still some nesting inc=stances you cna use traverse to unroll everything into one list . Group things ina list into a dict or a list and then use select to perform additional operations. 
 

       pip install pipe

```python
import pipe as pp
arr= [1,2,3,4,5]

list(arr | pp.where(lambda x : x%2==0) | pp.select(lambda x:x*2))   # [4,8]
list((1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
    | pp.groupby(lambda x:"Even" if x%2==0 else "Odd")
    |pp.select(lambda x:{x[0]:list(x[1] | pp.where(lambda x:x>=5))})) # [{'Even':[6,8],'Odd':[5,7,9]}]

list((1,2,2,3,4,5,6,5,4)| pp.dedup(lambda key:key<5))  # [1,5]

# pp.chain(function) - chain everything into one sequence of iterables 
# pp.traverse(function) - unnest everything
# pp.dedup(function) -  remove all duplicates
# pp.groupby(function) - use a group by function and then send it to select 


f()
```

* **Pre-Commits** -  pre-commit is a framework that allows you to identify simple issues in your code before committing it.
You can add different plugins to your pre-commit pipeline. Once your files are committed, they will be checked by these plugins. Unless all checks pass, no code will be committed. You can create a pre-commit pipeline and aff other plugins to it in a `config.yaml` file 

```yaml

repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/ambv/black
    rev: 20.8b1
    hooks:
    - id: black
-   repo: https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 3.8.4
    hooks:
    - id: flake8
-   repo: https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort
    rev: 5.7.0
    hooks:
    -   id: isort
-   repo: https://github.com/econchick/interrogate
    rev: 1.4.0  
    hooks:
    - id: interrogate
      args: [-vv, -i, --fail-under=80]

```

        
        pip install pre-commit  # 
        pip install black       # Code formatter
        pip install flake8      # Style and quality of code - checks for issues not covered by black
        pip install isort       # auto-sort and group imports and libraries
        pip install interrogate # Checks for missing docstrings

## Helper methods 

Sometime sit might take a lot of time to manually create a nested path for each experiment or model we create

```python
def create_path_if_not_exists(datapath):
    '''Create the new file if not exists and save the data'''

    if not os.path.exists(datapath):
        os.makedirs(datapath) 
        
if __name__=='__main__':
create_path_if_not_exists('model/model1/XGBoost/version_1')

```
