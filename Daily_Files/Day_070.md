## Which color scale to use when visualizing data

Certain chart types nudge you to color by certain variables.

A **choropleth map**, for example, already encodes the states by position: Florida is in the bottom right, Texas in the bottom center, etc. There’s no need to encode the states again with color. So you can encode the unemployment rate by color instead – for example, by making the fill color darker when the unemployment rate is higher.

**Categorical color scales**

Hues are what a five year old would understand under “different colors”: red, yellow, blue, etc. They’re perfect to distinguish between categories that don’t have an intrinsic order, like countries or ethnicities, genders or industries – that’s why these categorical color scales are sometimes called unordered color scales. In such a color scale, colors say “I’m not worth more or less than these other colors here!”

* Give your hues different lightnesses so that they’d work in greyscale, too. It makes them look better and easier to distinguish, which is especially important for colorblind readers. 
* You don’t need to design a color palette yourself. Lots of people have created amazing color combinations you can use.

**Sequential color scales**  

Sequential color scales are gradients that go from bright to dark or the other way round. They’re great for visualizing numbers that go from low to high, like income, temperature, or age. A medium blue on a white background, for example, lets your readers know: “My value is a bit higher than the light blue and a bit lower than the dark blue.”

Gradients can be classed (=split into brackets, also called classified, stepped, quantized, graduated, binned or discrete) or unclassed (=one continuous gradient):
* You can use only one hue in your sequential gradients (e.g., light blue to dark blue) – but almost all examples I show here use multiple hues (e.g., light yellow to dark blue). Using two or even more hues increases the color contrast between segments of your gradient, making it easier for readers to distinguish between them.

**Diverging color scales**

Diverging (also called bipolar or double-ended) color scales are the same as sequential color scales – but instead of just going from low to high, they have a bright middle value and then go darker to both ends of the scale in different hues. Diverging color scales are often used to visualize negative and positive values, election results, or Likert scales (“strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree”).

Like sequential color scales, diverging ones can be classed or unclassed:
