## SQL Tips and Tricks 

Common Table Expressions or CTEs are a powerful tool in your Querying toolbox that allows you to take complex, layered SELECT statements, break them down into more manageable chunks, and then pull them back together in the end.Each CTE can contain many SELECT statements, JOIN statements, WHERE clauses, etc. Use them to structure your query for readability and understandability

```sql
WITH
    cte_name AS (
        SELECT
            ...
    ),

another_cte AS (
    SELECT * FROM foo
    JOIN cte_name ON cte_name.id = foo.id
)

SELECT * FROM another_cte
LIMIT 10
```

```sql
WITH DAILY as (
    SELECT ID
    FROM "LOGS_DAILY"),
MAP AS (
    SELECT SOURCE_ID AS ID, ANY_VALUE(UUID) AS UUID
    FROM "CONTACT_MAP"
    WHERE SOURCE_ID_NAME = 'ID'
    AND DT = (SELECT MAX(DT) FROM "CONTACT_MAP")
    GROUP BY SOURCE_ID),
CONTACT AS (
    SELECT CONTACT_UUID, SITE_UUID
    FROM "CONTACT_MASTER"
    WHERE DT = (SELECT MAX(DT) FROM "CONTACT_MASTER")),
ACCOUNT AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM "ACCOUNT"
    WHERE SITE_STATUS = 'Active')
SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM DAILY
LEFT JOIN MAP ON MAP.ID = DAILY.ID
LEFT JOIN CONTACT ON CONTACT.CONTACT_UUID = MAP.CONTACT_UUID
LEFT JOIN ACCOUNT ON ACCOUNT.SITE_UUID = CONTACT.SITE_UUID
LIMIT 100

```
