# Day 284 of ML 

## Plotting Using Seaborn 

### KDE Plot

Get the sense of underlying distribution. Estimate pdf from finite data. Non-parametric way - we aren't assuming any underlying distribution like gaussian. Add a little kernel centered around each data point, for each data point. Eventually all we need to do is add all these together. You get closer and closer to the probability density function, and you can use any kind of kernel - gaussian , triangular, cosine

```python

import seaborn as sns
# Univariate 
sns.kdeplot(df.column_name)
sns.kdeplot(df.column_name,shade=True) # For aesthetic 

# Bandwidth, can make a huge difference. High value will smooth out and lose modes. 
# Low values will cause high variance and spiky looking plot
sns.kdeplot(df.column_name,bw=10)      
# We can also get CDF
sns.kdeplot(df.column_name,cumulative=True)

# Bivariate 
sns.kdeplot(df.column1,df.column2)
sns.kdeplot(df.column1,df.column2,shade=True,shade_lowest=False) # to keep background in place
sns.kdeplot(df.column1,df.column2,shade=True,shade_lowest=False,cbar=True) # for the range 
```   



### HistPlot

Distplot has been deprecated and you need to use histplot now for histograms. By default seaborn will try to decide how many bins are appropriate for your data . We also have a stats argument for the y axis to change what is being displayed . The default stat we look at is count

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('darkgrid')
sns.histplot(df.column_name) # Alternatively sns.histplot(x = column_name,data = df) 
sns.histplot(df.column_name,bins=20,binwidth=10,binrange=(30,60)) # well defined start and stop values 

# density - area of histogram must sum to 1
# probability -  height of histogram bars sums to 1
sns.histplot(df.column_name,stat='density')
sns.histplot(df.column_name,stat='probability',fill=False,element="step",cumulative=True)

# For categorical data 
sns.histplot(df.column_name,hue= "column_2") # Distributions per hue will overlap
# This will just show the outline of the hist. Instead of stp, choosing poly will create polygons
sns.histplot(df.column_name,hue= "column_2",element="step")
# Each of these were "layer" ed on top of each other in the multiple argument
# fill will show you proportion of each hue after scaling each bucket to range between 0 and 1
sns.histplot(df.column_name,hue= "column_2",multiple="stack")
# multiple= "dodge" will put them side by side. pait it up with shrink=0.8 to split x bars into groups 
sns.histplot(df.column_name,hue= "column_2",multiple="dodge",shrink=0.8,palette = "bone") # if you don't want the default blue orange legend

# Bivariate 
sns.histplot(x = "col1",y = "col2",data = df,cbar =True) # Since we lose the y axis stat
sns.histplot(x = "col1",y = "col2",data = df,hue ="col3") # But the distributions may overlap
sns.histplot(x = "col1",y = "col2",data = df,hue ="col2") # making y and hue the same to visualize all in one figure

sns.histplot(df.column_name,hue= "column_2")
```

### ECDF Plot

Empirical cumulative distribution function. Sort the values and on X axis we have the values and Y axis will be the proportion of the values we've observed. Unlike a histogram or kde plot there is no binning or smoothing and you can see how each value is affecting the CDF. Since we are plotting lines here it is easy to compare distributions across categories.But the cons are that we are unable to see the central tendencies of the distributions easily . It is also harder to detect when we have a bimodal distribution

Vertical lines means there are a lot of values that are same ass the point on x axis 

Great for comparing how values change in proportion per day of the week. Day being hue 

```python

import seaborn as sns
sns.ecdfplot(x="col1",data=df) # The chart will begin from the min and max value in the data
# To see what percentage of data is above or below a particular threshold
plt.axvline(x_axis_thres,c='black')


# Swap axes
sns.ecdfplot(y="col1",data=df) # Proportion will become x axis
plt.axvline(0.5,c='black') # Checking for 50% or median

# For different categories 
sns.ecdfplot(x="col1",data=df,hue="categorical_col2")
sns.ecdfplot(x="col1",data=df,stat="count", hue="day") # Shows both proportion and also counts of observations 
sns.ecdfplot(x="col1",data=df,stat="count", complementary=True) # Reverses the plot and effectively ranks the x axis 

sns.ecdfplot(x="col1",data=df,weights="col1") # Makinf x and weights same will tell us what % of value is coming from where
plt.axhline(0.5,c='black')

```
