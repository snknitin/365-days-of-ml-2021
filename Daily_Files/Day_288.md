## Plotting with seaborn

### Jointplot

 Looks at distribution of two variables as well as the relationship between them. Scatter is default but you can choose from kde,reg,hist,hex and resid
 
 * Center -  relationship plot of how X and Y are related to give a joint distribution of our data. Can change using `kind`
 * Top and right - Marginal distributions  

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('darkgrid')
sns.jointplot(x='col1',y='col2',data=df)
sns.jointplot(x='col1',y='col2',data=df, kind='kde')

# Returns an JointGrid object, so you cna add more plots on top of this 
g= sns.jointplot(x='col1',y='col2',data=df)
g.plot_joint(sns.kdeplot, color='gray',levels=5)

# If you have categorical feature, you cna use it as a hue
# height =  12,space=0.2, ratio = 5

joint_kws = {} # send keywords corresponding to the scatter plot in the center
marginal_kws = {}

```


### FacetGrid

Backbone for the Catplot,relplot and displot . Main idea is that we will be creating **small multiples**. We pick out a categorical feature and create one plot for each and every category.  

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('white')
sns.FacetGrid(df) # Just blank x and y axes 
g = sns.FacetGrid(df,col='cat_col') # FacetGrid Object. you can use row as well instead of col to have vertical plots 
# if you give both it will be a grid of row,col combinations of the 2 categorical column values 

# Map plots on these blank axes 
g.map(sns.histplot,'cat_col',  sharey=False, ylim=(20,70), hue='cat_col2') # hue needs to be here and not in subsequent ones
# Stop sharing y axis limits or ticks and set your own range if you want uniformity with ylim 

g.map_dataframe(sns.histplot, x = 'cat_col1') # kwargs passsed here will  be specific to the plots here 
g.map_dataframe(sns.scatterplot, x = 'col1',y='col2') 

# you can pass dataframe as long as it has a data argument which you can customize

# Methods and attributes to style it 

g.set_axis_labels('X label','Y label')
g.set_titles(col_template='{col_name} Value',row_template='{row_name} Value')
