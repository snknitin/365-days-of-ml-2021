## Plotting with seaborn

### Jointplot

 Looks at distribution of two variables as well as the relationship between them. Scatter is default but you can choose from kde,reg,hist,hex and resid
 
 * Center -  relationship plot of how X and Y are related to give a joint distribution of our data. Can change using `kind`
 * Top and right - Marginal distributions  

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('darkgrid')
sns.jointplot(x='col1',y='col2',data=df)
sns.jointplot(x='col1',y='col2',data=df, kind='kde')

# Returns an JointGrid object, so you cna add more plots on top of this 
g= sns.jointplot(x='col1',y='col2',data=df)
g.plot_joint(sns.kdeplot, color='gray',levels=5)

# If you have categorical feature, you cna use it as a hue
# height =  12,space=0.2, ratio = 5

joint_kws = {} # send keywords corresponding to the scatter plot in the center
marginal_kws = {}

f()
