## Jupyter notebooks - Tips and shortcuts 


* `%` is the magic command that runs only on a single line
* `%%` is also the magic command but can run on multiple lines in a cell
* `%matplotlib inline` is used to display plots onto the notebook directly and `%matplotlib widget` that enables your plots to be interactive. Helps you zoom in
* `%%time` to check code execution time in that cell
* `%autosave 120` if you want to autosave your notebook every 120 seconds 
* `%who` is especially useful to check what are some of the running variables currently stored in-memory.
* You can run an external Python script using the `%run <FILENAME.py>` magic command
* To copy and paste a block of code to an external file, say as a Python script,do this by using `%%writefile <FILENAME.py>` 
* Similar to cat in any unix-based OS, we have the `%pycat <FILENAME.py>` to print out the content of any file. 
* We can further inspect our variable of interest using `%pinfo <VARIABLE>`
* If you have multiple data across notebooks that need to be shared, you can easily do so by using the `%store <var_name>` command and retrieve it in another notebook using `%store -r <var_name>`
* **Listing all available magic command by running `%lsmagic`**
