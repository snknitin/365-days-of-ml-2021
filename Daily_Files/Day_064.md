## Violin Plots

The goal is to find the probability density for each category.

1) Violin plots are used to visualize data with its probability density at different values.  
2) Violin plots are great if you want to look at a set of data values for a category and analyse the highest, lowest and most probable value.  
3) These values can also be compared across multiple categories.  
4) Violin plots look beautiful and can be plotted horizontally or vertically. 



### Density curves 


The density curve, aka kernel density plot or kernel density estimate (KDE), is a less-frequently encountered depiction of data distribution, compared to the more common histogram.  

In a KDE, each data point contributes a small area around its true value. The shape of this area is called the kernel function. Kernels can take different shapes from smooth bell curves to sharp triangular peaks. In addition, kernels can have different width, or bandwidth, affecting the influence of each individual data point. Bandwidth size is usually determined by using mathematical rules of thumb, but can be tweaked depending on the shape and skew of the data to be plotted

To build the final density curve, the areas for all data points are stacked up into a complete whole. Each data point has an equivalent influence on the final distribution. As there are more data points in a region, the height of the density curve in that area will increase.

* Best used when a fair amount of data is available, resulting in more stable density estimates. 
* With few data points available, it can be easy to be misled by the smoothness of the curve or the length of the tails past the largest and smallest points.

In a violin plot, individual density curves are built around center lines, rather than stacked on baselines. Other than this difference in display pattern, curves in a violin plot follow the exact same construction and interpretation.

* While setting up a KDE requires worrying about kernel shape and bandwidth, creation of a histogram requires consideration of bin sizes and where edges will be aligned. For both chart types, the choice of these parameters can affect how the final plot looks.

### When to use

* The goal with using a violin plot is to **show the range of values for a certain category**, what is the probability density, or in other words what is the most likely value, and how this compares to the other categories.
* Violin plots can be used for **category comparison and trends over time** if comparing value distribution between categories.
* when you want to observe the distribution of numeric data, and are especially useful when you want to make a comparison of distributions between multiple groups.


* If there are many groups to plot, the box plot’s simplicity can be a major boon. Any individual box and whiskers needs much less space to be readable than a density curve. Where space is a concern or showing a statistical summary is of top importance, the box plot can be preferable to a violin plot.



If you are dealing with big discrepancies in the data values  - use a bar chart.  
Violin plots also work best when you are dealing with similar number across the categories you are comparing 

The most common way to structure data for creating a violin plot is through a table with two columns. Each row corresponds with a single data point, while cell values indicate group membership and numeric value for each point. All of the plot features will be automatically calculated from this raw input. If all of the data is in a single group, then the column indicating group membership will not be necessary.


### How to read it

The top, bottom and middle of the violin are the highest, lowest and middle value point respectively  
Widest part of the violin shows the highest probability and can appear on any spectrum of its height, it can be close to the highest, lowest or mid value point.

Unlike bar charts you can plot your violin chart starting with a number higher than 0. With bar charts if you don’t start at 0 your visual will be significantly skewed. With violin charts you can start just a little below your lowest value point. 


### Things to keep in mind when plotting

* When the groups in a violin plot do not have an inherent ordering,sorting groups by median value makes it so that the ranking of groups is immediately evident.

* **Flourish** This is currently the only tool that allows you to easily and quickly build a violin plot. In Flourish you can choose to include beeswarm chart within your violin plot if you are plotting a categorical and numerical data.  It can also help you make videos of barcharts
    * Flourish also has **Sankey Graphs** that are flow charts which use the width of the arrows to show the value of the flow rate between two categories.

* Overlay with additional chart type - If symmetry, skew, or other shape and variability characteristics are different between groups, it can be difficult to make precise comparisons of density curves between groups. It is for this reason that violin plots are usually rendered with another overlaid chart type. **the violin plot is sometimes described as a combination of KDE and box plot**. In certain cases, only a subset of box plot features will be plotted to reduce the visual noise, such as three lines indicating quartile positions, without the whiskers.

*  A rug plot or strip plot adds every data point to the center line as a tick mark or dot, like a 1-d scatter plot.
*  A swarm plot offsets the data points from the central line to avoid overlaps.
* An alternative strategy is to randomly jitter points from the center line; jittering is easier to perform, though it does not guarantee avoidance of overlaps.

* Horizontally-oriented violin plots are a good choice when you need to display long group names or when there are a lot of groups to plot. 
* It is usually easier to expand a plot on its vertical axis than its horizontal; this is important when we need enough room to clearly observe a density curve’s shape.

* **Ridgeline Plot** - An alternative way of comparing distributions between groups using density curves is with the ridgeline plot.
    * A ridgeline plot is comprised of a vertical stack of regular density curves. 
    * Usually, the curves are offset with a slight overlap, which can save space compared to completely separating the axes. 
    * This overlap means that the density curves tend to be plotted without any additional overlays.
    * Ridgeline plots are best used when there is a clear pattern in the data across groups.
