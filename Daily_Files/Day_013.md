# Day 13 of ML 

## Data Cleaning and Preprocesing

* Reduce the size of dataframes but make sure you don't choose `float16` for datatypes as those will cause overflow issues and are not supoorted by many packages
* Be careful when dealing with zero inflated skew count data and use log transform after making it fully positive by adding the abs(min) of the data plus an offset like 0.01
