## Causal design patterns

 The need to understand true causal (versus correlative) effects and to derive meaning and strategy from “found” historical data (as opposed to experimentally “produced” data) is nearly universal, but methods are scattered across epidemiology, economics, political science, and more.

 To measure a causal effect, we want to somehow consider the potential outcomes and be able to contrast the average outcome under the treatment versus the average outcome under a counterfactual scenario in which similar observations went untreated.
 
 To create this counterfactual without true randomization, these methods attempt to exploit different sources of partial random variation4 while avoiding different types of confounding in order to derive a valid inference.

 
* **Stratification**

When you have “similar” treated and untreated individuals with different distributions on a small number of relevant dimensions, use stratification helps to rebalance these groups to make their average effects more comparable


* **Propensity Score Weighting**

* **Regression Discontinuity**

    When you have disjoint treated and untreated individuals separated by a sharp cut-off, use the arbitrary variation in treatment assignment for those right above or below the cut-off to measure a local causal effect
    
    
* **Difference in Differences**
  ![alt text](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/causal-design-patterns/excalidraw-did.png)
 
    When you have group-level treatments or data available, use random variation across populations to compare their overall trends over time
    

When to use what

* If you have significant overlap between “similar” treated and untreated individuals but the treatment was not randomly assigned, stratification or propensity score weighting can help you rebalance your data so that your treated and untreated groups have a more similar distribution of traits and their average outcomes are more comparable
* If you have disjoint treated and untreated groups partitioned by a sharp cut-off, regression discontinuity allows you to measure the local treatment effect at the juncture between groups
* If treatments are assigned to different populations, difference-in-differences and event study methods help to compare different groups across multiple time periods.
