## Plotting with Seaborn


### Stripplot

Plots values on a number line to show frequency and uses something called jitter to move points up and down when they are repeated.It is a categorical scatter plot. It is like swarm plot but dots are arranged rnadomly and not in a straight line. You can display more data in the strip plot than a swarm plot

If you think of the width as 1, jitter is how much plus or minus the point can possibly be

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
# this will make a separate strip for each hue
sns.stripplot(x=col1,y=col2,data=df, hue=col3, dodge=True) 
# Collapse all points onto one line
sns.stripplot(x=col1,y=col2,data=df, hue=col3, jitter=False)  #default is 0.1
# make them transparent to see and change dot size
sns.stripplot(x=col1,y=col2,data=df, hue=col3, alpha=0.3,size=3,marker="*") 


# You can use tweak the jitter in an interactive widget to see how it changes 
from ipywidgets import interactive
def jitterwidget(jitter=0.1):
    sns.stripplot(x=col1,y=col2,data=df, hue=col3, jitter=jitter) 

interactive(jitterwidget,jitter = (0,0.65,0.05))
# this will give you a scale that you can move a button to vary the value 

```



### Scatter plot

This is a relational plot. we are interested in the relation between two variables and want to see if there are any correlations. 

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('dark')
sns.scatterplot(x=col1,y=col2,data=df,hue=col3) # you can also use a continuous variable for hue
# Using style='col3' will choose different markers for each hue 
# Size='col3' does the same as above but with size of the markers and then modify with sizes = [] to provide a list 

```



### Lineplot

Demonstrate continuous relationship between two values, most likely with respect to time on x axis, and this helps you track seasonality and trends. 
Seaborn cna give you the mean of the observations in the day and gets the confidence interval using bootstrap sampling. This means it samples uniformly with replacement . Default is n_boot =  . By creating thousand bootstrap samples and getting their means sorted, we identify intervals that have 95% of the sorted means and this gives the lower and upper bounds for the lineplot 

if you reduce n_boot to 10 you'll see a lot of variance by which i mean, running it multiple times will give multiple bounds 

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('dark')
months = [pd.datetime(2016,10,1),pd.datetime(2016,11,1),pd.datetime(2016,12,1)]
plt.rc('dateautoformatter',day = '%b %Y')

sns.lineplot(df.day,df.col1)
plt.xticks(months)
# setting ci=None will remove the confidence interval 
# setting estimator = 'std' / 'sum' will give you std or sum instead of mean
# using hue will create multiple line plots 

```





### Regplot

Visualize regression models. It has a scatter plot and a regression best fit line. setting `fit_reg=False` will remove the line and leave you with just scatterplot. `scatter=False` does vice versa but then you will have to set axis limits for the line. If you choose discrete values in x axis the scatter plot will cluster points so you can use `jitter` and instead of plotting each of these scatter poitns you can use `x_estimator=np.mean`

* order = 2  means polynomial regression 
* robust = True means fit to the majority of data points and ignore outliers that might throw off the best fit line 
* logistic = incase one of the variables is binary
* lowess = Locally weighted scatter plot smoothing - gives you a smooth curve 

All these are mutually exclusive so you can only shoose one . if you have confoundign variables you can pass them to `{x,y} partial` 

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('dark')
plt.gca().set(xlim=(0,2.6)) # 
sns.regplot(x = col1,y=col2, data=df)

# You can use the argument scatter_kws = {'s':10,'alpha':0.05, '':} and line_kws = {}

```
